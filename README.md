## Attendance
Aqui is an app that allows users to take attendance quickly and reliably. The app alows the user to display a morphing dynamic QR code to the audience who are then able to use the app to scan the GIF and check into the class. By using a constantly changing QR code the app makes it nearly impossible for those not in the classroom to check in. Aqui then allows the user to acess attendance information.
